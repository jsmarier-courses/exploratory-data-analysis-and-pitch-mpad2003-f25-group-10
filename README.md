## Project Summary, Methodology, and Key Observations

Our project analyzes how geography influences education choices across Ottawa’s 24 wards, using the 2021 Canadian Census dataset. We focused on comparing data with STEM and Arts degrees to uncover regional patterns. The data was obtained from the City of Ottawa’s Open Data Portal and cleaned in Google Sheets. We removed irrelevant columns, trimmed extra spaces, deleted duplicates, and froze the first row for clarity. After cleaning, we created pivot tables and bar charts to visualize trends, finding that western wards like Kanata North and Stittsville lean toward STEM, while central areas such as Capital and Rideau-Vanier favor Arts and Communications.
